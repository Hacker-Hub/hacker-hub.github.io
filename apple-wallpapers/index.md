How did I get these wallpapers?  
Since iOS 10, all Apple IPSW files have been unencrypted. This means that all you have to do is download an IPSW file (in this case, I used the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max) and change the extension from `.ipsw` to `.zip`. Then you can just unzip the file and you have the root of iOS. To get to the Wallpapers, you'll need to have a Mac running macOS High Sierra or macOS Mojave if you are extracting any IPSW files for iOS 10.3+. The largest `.dmg` file will have everything from wallpapers to audio files. Once the largest `.dmg` file is mounted navigate to `Library > Wallpapers`. Keep in mind the DMG is read only, so you'll need to copy the wallpapers to use them.
